======================
	   PRIORITY
======================

1	Fork processes that need own window correctly
	Probably only one that shouldn't be forked is text editor

2	/bin/*command* instead of *command* ^^related

3	Parse the config file and store the extensions in the array named AUDIO, DOC, etc
	start at '[', while loop until ']'

4	Array of directory names...
	even numbers (0,2,etc) are the directory names (char*)
	odd are the current index before switching directories,etc
	have a finite number of array entries, when the size gets too large fifo it

5	Add Enter key case in main loop (for opening file, same as 'l')


======================
	   DO LATER 
======================

Apostrophes cause a segmentation fault when opening a file or changing into dir

Add shortcut/command to clone current moonrabbit instance into new window

Only toggle dotfiles if dotfile_count > 0!!!
	quick function in entry
		parameter = entry array
		return 1 on first hidden file
		else ret 0
	OR -> might be better to take in a var for dot_count when making the entry
		array, and set it to the number of dot files (increment every time filename starts with .)

Add case to switch for numbers...
	As long as the input is a number, record it

Then as soon as getch() is not a digit, execute the command 'x' times

Find file in dir with '/', move to index if exists

Also (later) allow find from command input prompt

Storing index/position from prev/forw dirs:

When ':' is pressed, start accepting input

Add directory with mkdir

Check permissions before chdir or opening file

Scrolling:
	upward scrolling
